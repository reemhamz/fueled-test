# herbalove-shoppe

Concept:
Create functional shopping cart that updates prices based on quantity and removal of items

Method of code:
- Complete vanilla JS utilized in this project. Zero JS plugins or extensions.
- Used Sass for styling, as it is more modular and enables a hierchal structure while coding; less spaghetti code.
- Utilized object-oriented programming (OOP) in my JavaScript. This made the process a lot more organized and thoughts were well kept; no spaghetti code.
- Prioritized user experience while building the shopping cart. I wanted full functionality and user interaction on all buttons and forms.
- For mobile design: I looked into eBay and Amazon to see how their shopping carts were designed and did something similar, so I decided to remove the product information bar since there was almost no need for it on mobile.
- For font styling, it is encouraged to use either EM or REM for sizing rather than pixels, so I stuck with REM and defined the HTML body to have a font-size of 62.5% in order for me to easily calculate REM while referring to Figma design mockup.
