# fueled-test

This was a technical challenge presented to me by Fueled, and it is to be shared to them.

Concept:
Receive a design mockup of an order summary and code it completely using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Use minimal 3rd party tools (i.e. no React, no jQuery).

Method of code:
- Complete vanilla JS utilized in this project. Zero JS plugins or extensions.
- Only external script tag used was Font Awesome in order to place a remove button I was happy with (could delay performance if used heavily, so used fairly frugally).
- Used Sass for styling, as it is more modular and enables a hierchal structure while coding; less spaghetti code.
- Utilized object-oriented programming (OOP) in my JavaScript. This made the process a lot more organized and thoughts were well kept; no spaghetti code.
- Prioritized user experience while building the shopping cart. I wanted full functionality and user interaction on all buttons and forms.
- For mobile design: I looked into eBay and Amazon to see how their shopping carts were designed and did something similar, so I decided to remove the product information bar since there was almost no need for it on mobile.
- For font styling, it is encouraged to use either EM or REM for sizing rather than pixels, so I stuck with REM and defined the HTML body to have a font-size of 62.5% in order for me to easily calculate REM while referring to Figma design mockup.

How to install project:
Since this is a simple project, it is very simple to install -
- Open up terminal / command line and go into the directory you'd wish to place the existing repo using the ``cd`` command
- (Optional step: If you'd like to contribute to this repo, write ``git init`` to initialize folder)
- Once you ``cd`` into your desired folder, write ``git clone https://github.com/reemhamz/fueled-test/``
- This should glone and download the repo into your folder.
- Go into the repo folder that has just been cloned and open up ``index.html``
